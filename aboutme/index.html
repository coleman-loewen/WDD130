    <h1>All about me!</h1>
    <img src="images/snowy.jpg" alt="canadian winter" width="300">
    <p>Hi I'm Coleman Loewen, but you can call me Cole. I'm from the
        berry capital of Canada Abbotsford BC. I'm here at BYUI to get a 
        CIT degree with an emphasis in Cybersecurity. I plan on having a
        career in cybersecurity red teaming, and penetration testing. 
        A fun fact about me is that I am a total nerd! I love all things
        Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Marvel, and too many others to count.
        I'm an avid reader and have been since I learned how to.  I also love
        writing my own stories and finding other ways to release my creativity 
        such as Dungeons and Dragons. I also really enjoy music both as a listener
        and as a player, but trust me I'm not very good at playing
        But I am learning to play guitar and hope to one day at least be good
        enough to play at a campfire.
