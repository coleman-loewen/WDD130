            <h2>Red team engagement</h2>
            <p>With your permission we will take on the role of a cyber criminal and attempt to "break into" your
                company. It will be a combination of physical and digital attacks to search for "red flags":
                vulnerabilites that hackers could exploit. When the attack is finished we will give you an accurate and
                detailed report of every problem we found along with our reccommendations on how to best fix it. The
                baseline price of our red team begins at $40,000. Prices are liable to change based on the length and
                scope of the target.</p>
