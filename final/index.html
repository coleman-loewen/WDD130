            <h4>What we do</h4>
            <p>We will help strengthen your business against cyber attacks by a multi faceted approach of staff training
                and Red team engagements. Red teaming, or penetration testing is the process of simulating an attack on a company to help
                reveal their vulerabilities and correct them. By using this approach to defend your business, it will be more effective than passive protections.
                 We also offer seminars where we will train your staff on how to
                defend from different security threats, such as phishing, and social engineering</p>
