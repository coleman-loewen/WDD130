            <h1>Keep your data safe with Cyber Sword.</h1>
            <p>Cyber crime is on the rise, and in our increasingly technological world reliable access to data can
                determine the survival of your company. That is why we at Cyber sword believe that the best defense is
                having a strong offense. Our team of professional security analysts will give your company the edge you
                need to defend yourself against the rising storm of cyber crime. </p>

            <h4>What we do</h4>
            <p>We will help strengthen your business against cyber attacks by a multi faceted approach of staff training
                and Red team engagements. Red teaming, or penetration testing is the process of simulating an attack on a company to help
                reveal their vulerabilities and correct them. By using this approach to defend your business, it will be more effective than passive protections.
                 We also offer seminars where we will train your staff on how to
                defend from different security threats, such as phishing, and social engineering</p>
