      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>In our ever expanding world of technology, every new device, or software update comes new vulnerabilities and glitches that malicious hackers are waiting to exploit. That is why I will be creating a new website for a cybersecurity consulting company I hope to one day create. The main focus of the website will be to sell cybersecurity consultation services. A secondary purpose will be to inform people why they need that service. The website will also provide information about the day to day changes they can make and ways that it can benefit them.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website will be directed towards business owners who want to better protect their companies digital assets. With that audience in mind the design of the website will reflect a professional style. The color choice hints towards the typical steroetypes of hacking/cybersecurity</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will be coming to my site because they are concerned about the security of their business, that could be anywhere from a small business, to large corporations. The immediate objective of the website will be to grow that concern that they have until they feel that they can’t get by without my help. To do that one of the first things they will see upon arrival is information about cyber crime, such as how in the year 2021 there was $6 trillion worth of damage done by cyber crime, and that in the coming years that number is projected to rise to nearly double that by 2025. Or that in 2021 there was also a record breaking number of data breaches and the average cost of each breach is $4.24 million and rising.
When they arrive at the website they will undoubtedly have a few questions such as “What is Penetration testing? How much will this cost? What is your procedure? What are your qualifications? The bulk of those questions will be answered on the home page, which will mostly be a page filled with information, as stated above there will be cyber crime statistics but there will also be information about how our company will help you prevent those cyber crimes from taking place.
